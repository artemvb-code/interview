Here are some API-related interview questions with short answers:

üîπ API Basics

1Ô∏è‚É£ What is an API?
	‚Ä¢	An Application Programming Interface (API) allows different software components to communicate.

2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the types of APIs?
	‚Ä¢	REST, SOAP, GraphQL, WebSockets, gRPC.

3Ô∏è‚É£ What is a REST API?
	‚Ä¢	A stateless API using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to communicate.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What are the key principles of REST?
	‚Ä¢	Statelessness, Client-Server Architecture, Cacheability, Layered System, Uniform Interface.

5Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between REST and SOAP?
	‚Ä¢	REST: Lightweight, JSON/XML, uses HTTP methods.
	‚Ä¢	SOAP: Heavy, XML-only, strict messaging format.

üîπ HTTP Methods & Status Codes

6Ô∏è‚É£ What are common HTTP methods used in APIs?
	‚Ä¢	GET: Read data
	‚Ä¢	POST: Create data
	‚Ä¢	PUT: Update data
	‚Ä¢	DELETE: Remove data

7Ô∏è‚É£ What are common HTTP status codes in APIs?
	‚Ä¢	200 OK ‚Äì Success
	‚Ä¢	201 Created ‚Äì Resource created
	‚Ä¢	400 Bad Request ‚Äì Client error
	‚Ä¢	401 Unauthorized ‚Äì Invalid authentication
	‚Ä¢	403 Forbidden ‚Äì No permission
	‚Ä¢	404 Not Found ‚Äì Resource missing
	‚Ä¢	500 Internal Server Error ‚Äì Server issue

üîπ API Authentication & Security

8Ô∏è‚É£ How do you secure an API?
	‚Ä¢	OAuth2, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), API Keys, Rate Limiting, CORS, Encryption (TLS).

9Ô∏è‚É£ What is OAuth2?
	‚Ä¢	A secure authentication framework using tokens instead of passwords.

üîü What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
	‚Ä¢	A compact, self-contained token used for authentication and information exchange.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ What is CORS?
	‚Ä¢	Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) controls which domains can access an API.

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ How do you prevent API abuse?
	‚Ä¢	Rate limiting, IP whitelisting, authentication, logging, and bot detection.

üîπ API Performance & Optimization

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ How do you optimize API performance?
	‚Ä¢	Use caching (Redis, CDNs), pagination, database indexing, compression (Gzip), and async processing.

1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ What is API pagination?
	‚Ä¢	A method to split large datasets into smaller pages using parameters like limit & offset.

1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ How does API caching work?
	‚Ä¢	Stores frequent responses in memory (Redis, Cloudflare) to reduce database queries.

1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle long-running API requests?
	‚Ä¢	Asynchronous processing (queues), background jobs, or WebSockets for real-time updates.

üîπ API Design & Best Practices

1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ What is a good practice for designing RESTful APIs?
	‚Ä¢	Use clear resource naming (/users, /orders), versioning (/v1/users), and proper status codes.

1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle API versioning?
	‚Ä¢	URL versioning (/v1/), query parameters (?version=2), or headers (Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=2).

1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ What is HATEOAS?
	‚Ä¢	Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) allows APIs to return links for navigation.

2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ What is an idempotent API?
	‚Ä¢	Calling an idempotent API multiple times has the same effect (e.g., PUT and DELETE are idempotent).

üîπ Advanced API Topics

2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ What is GraphQL, and how is it different from REST?
	‚Ä¢	GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, unlike REST‚Äôs fixed endpoints.

2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ What is WebSockets, and when should you use it?
	‚Ä¢	A full-duplex protocol for real-time communication (e.g., chat apps, live notifications).

2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What is API Gateway?
	‚Ä¢	A central entry point for APIs that manages security, rate limiting, authentication, and routing.

2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ How do you monitor API performance?
	‚Ä¢	Use APM tools (Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus), logging, and API analytics.

2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle API errors?
	‚Ä¢	Return clear error messages (400 Bad Request), structured JSON responses, and logs for debugging.

üî• Final Tip

Be ready for scenario-based questions (e.g., debugging API issues, designing a scalable API, or implementing security).
