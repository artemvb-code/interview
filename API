Here are some API-related interview questions with short answers:

🔹 API Basics

What is an API?
	•	An Application Programming Interface (API) allows different software components to communicate.

What are the types of APIs?
	•	REST, SOAP, GraphQL, WebSockets, gRPC.

What is a REST API?
	•	A stateless API using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to communicate.
What are the key principles of REST?
	•	Statelessness, Client-Server Architecture, Cacheability, Layered System, Uniform Interface.
What is the difference between REST and SOAP?
	•	REST: Lightweight, JSON/XML, uses HTTP methods.
	•	SOAP: Heavy, XML-only, strict messaging format.

🔹 HTTP Methods & Status Codes

What are common HTTP methods used in APIs?
	•	GET: Read data
	•	POST: Create data
	•	PUT: Update data
	•	DELETE: Remove data

What are common HTTP status codes in APIs?
	•	200 OK – Success
	•	201 Created – Resource created
	•	400 Bad Request – Client error
	•	401 Unauthorized – Invalid authentication
	•	403 Forbidden – No permission
	•	404 Not Found – Resource missing
	•	500 Internal Server Error – Server issue

🔹 API Authentication & Security

How do you secure an API?
	•	OAuth2, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), API Keys, Rate Limiting, CORS, Encryption (TLS).

What is OAuth2?
	•	A secure authentication framework using tokens instead of passwords.
What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
	•	A compact, self-contained token used for authentication and information exchange.

What is CORS?
	•	Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) controls which domains can access an API.

How do you prevent API abuse?
	•	Rate limiting, IP whitelisting, authentication, logging, and bot detection.

🔹 API Performance & Optimization

How do you optimize API performance?
	•	Use caching (Redis, CDNs), pagination, database indexing, compression (Gzip), and async processing.

What is API pagination?
	•	A method to split large datasets into smaller pages using parameters like limit & offset.

How does API caching work?
	•	Stores frequent responses in memory (Redis, Cloudflare) to reduce database queries.

How do you handle long-running API requests?
	•	Asynchronous processing (queues), background jobs, or WebSockets for real-time updates.

🔹 API Design & Best Practices

What is a good practice for designing RESTful APIs?
	•	Use clear resource naming (/users, /orders), versioning (/v1/users), and proper status codes.

How do you handle API versioning?
	•	URL versioning (/v1/), query parameters (?version=2), or headers (Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=2).

What is HATEOAS?
	•	Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) allows APIs to return links for navigation.

What is an idempotent API?
	•	Calling an idempotent API multiple times has the same effect (e.g., PUT and DELETE are idempotent).

🔹 Advanced API Topics

What is GraphQL, and how is it different from REST?
	•	GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, unlike REST’s fixed endpoints.

What is WebSockets, and when should you use it?
	•	A full-duplex protocol for real-time communication (e.g., chat apps, live notifications).

What is API Gateway?
	•	A central entry point for APIs that manages security, rate limiting, authentication, and routing.

How do you monitor API performance?
	•	Use APM tools (Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus), logging, and API analytics.

How do you handle API errors?
	•	Return clear error messages (400 Bad Request), structured JSON responses, and logs for debugging.

🔥 Final Tip

Be ready for scenario-based questions (e.g., debugging API issues, designing a scalable API, or implementing security).
