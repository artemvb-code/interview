	1.	What frameworks or principles would you apply to ensure AI governance and compliance?
	2.	How do you handle data privacy considerations under regulations like GDPR or CCPA in AI projects?
	3.	How do you ensure fairness and transparency in ML/GenAI outputs?
	4.	What’s your approach to documenting AI decisions for auditability?
	5.	How would you respond to a stakeholder concerned about AI replacing human jobs?


⚙️ Project Execution & Delivery
	1.	Describe your experience using Agile or Scrum for data science or AI projects.
	2.	How do you manage project scope and change requests in an ML or GenAI initiative?
	3.	What tools or platforms have you used to support AI project delivery (e.g., Azure ML, AWS Sagemaker, OpenAI APIs)?
	4.	How do you handle post-deployment monitoring and continuous improvement for AI systems?
	5.	What’s your approach to quantifying ROI for AI projects?

💬 Scenario-Based Questions
	1.	A stakeholder asks for an AI solution but cannot define the problem clearly. How would you proceed?
	2.	The model shows good accuracy but business users are unhappy with the results — how do you handle it?
	3.	You discover the model output has a gender or cultural bias. What’s your next step?
	4.	The data science team uses complex terminology the business doesn’t understand — how do you bridge that gap?
	5.	You’re asked to prioritize between explainability and accuracy — which would you choose and why?
